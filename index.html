										<h2 class="major">Project 1: Clinic website</h2>
										<p>As a beginner in web development, I was tasked with building a website for a physiotherapy clinic using only HTML. Despite having no prior experience in building a website, I took on the challenge and learned a lot throughout the process. As I coded the website, I researched different HTML tags, learned how to structure a webpage, and experimented with different styles and layouts. I encountered several challenges, such as figuring out how to create a responsive design that would work on different screen sizes, but I persevered and was able to overcome them with the help of online resources and tutorials. Overall, building the website for the physiotherapy clinic was a valuable learning experience that helped me improve my coding skills and gain confidence in my ability to tackle new challenges.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Project 2: Hoop Net</h2>
										<p>During my design class as an engineering student, I had the opportunity to collaborate with two other students on a project for Urban Roots London, a local farming company. Our objective was to automate their existing humidity control systems, specifically their hoop house lift-sides and fans, with the aim of eliminating the need for manual intervention. Through this project, I was able to apply my engineering knowledge to a real-world problem and work alongside my peers to develop an innovative solution.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Project 3: Games</h2>
									<p>In my free time, I enjoy coding small 2D games for fun in Python. It's a hobby that allows me to challenge myself creatively while also strengthening my programming skills. By experimenting with different features and mechanics in my games, I have been able to learn more about Python syntax, data structures, and algorithms. It's a fun and engaging way to practice coding and has helped me improve my skills in a tangible way.</p>
